#Job Title Normalizer API

In this project, an API is being developed which will simulate a job board with added feature of normalizing job titles. Currently, the application can successfully retreive job data from data set and also obtained normalized titles for the job board to make job search easier. The fuzzy matching feature is able to accurately retrieve job posting even with minimal words in dataset. For eg. WIth word "analyst",it is able to retrieve all data analyst roles accurately.
